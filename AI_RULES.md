# Tech Stack

- You are building a React application.
- Use TypeScript.
- Use React Router. KEEP the routes in src/App.tsx
- Always put source code in the src folder.
- Put pages into src/pages/
- Put components into src/components/
- The main page (default page) is src/pages/Index.tsx
- UPDATE the main page to include the new components. OTHERWISE, the user can NOT see any components!
- ALWAYS try to use the shadcn/ui library.
- Tailwind CSS: always use Tailwind CSS for styling components. Utilize Tailwind classes extensively for layout, spacing, colors, and other design aspects.

Available packages and libraries:

- The lucide-react package is installed for icons.
- You ALREADY have ALL the shadcn/ui components and their dependencies installed. So you don't need to install them again.
- You have ALL the necessary Radix UI components installed.
- Use prebuilt components from the shadcn/ui library after importing them. Note that these files shouldn't be edited, so make new components if you need to change them.

## Nitro Server Layer

This project has a Nitro server layer for backend API routes. A `nitro.config.ts` at the app root sets `serverDir: "./server"` — do not move or remove it.

### vite.config.ts

`vite.config.ts` already imports `nitro` from `"nitro/vite"` and registers `nitro()` as the LAST entry in the `plugins` array. Do not move it earlier — it must run after Vite's module-transform middleware, otherwise Nitro's SPA fallback intercepts Vite internal URLs (`/src/*.tsx`, `/@vite/client`, `/@react-refresh`, `/@fs/*`) and returns `index.html`, breaking the preview.

### API Route Conventions

- Write routes in `server/routes/api/` (NEVER top-level `/api/`)
- Use `defineHandler` from `"nitro"` for handlers
- Dynamic routes: `[param].ts`
- Method-specific: `hello.get.ts`, `hello.post.ts`
- Runtime config: `useRuntimeConfig()` (env vars prefixed with `NITRO_`)

### Security Rules

NEVER import server-side code (database clients, secrets, env vars) in client-side React components. Server code lives in `server/` only.
